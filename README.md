# Johan SÃ¼ld
I'm an AI & ML Student at ITHS which I applied to due to my strong interest in Data and Statistics. I have over 10 years of experience in different Data Analytic roles, and a Bachelor degree in Statistics with System Science focus.

The portfolio below will in time be fleshed out with real and relevant projects, at the moment it consists of placeholders.
